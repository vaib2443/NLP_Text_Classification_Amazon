This report explores Topic Modeling with Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the
application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Topic Modelling is a technique of text analysis to
discover hidden patterns and topic clusters. LDA is one of the many topic modeling techniques and is
a classification method of unsupervised machine learning. The Topic Modeling using NLP will be
applied to the Amazon Fine Food Review Dataset. This report also explores the method of converting
unstructured data to a structured form. The main objective of this report is to find the product
categories that have good reviews on Amazon.
